ScAIm Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 13, 2026


Summary: ScAIm does not collect, store, transmit, or log any user data. All analysis runs entirely within your browser. There are no servers, no analytics, and no tracking of any kind.


What ScAIm Does

ScAIm is a browser extension that analyzes web pages for potential scam indicators such as phishing attempts, social engineering tactics, and fraudulent e-commerce patterns. It warns users by displaying a banner overlay on suspicious pages.


Data Collection

ScAIm collects no data whatsoever. Specifically:

- No personal information is collected
- No browsing history is recorded
- No page content is stored or transmitted
- No cookies are set by ScAIm
- No analytics or telemetry data is gathered
- No user behavior is tracked
- No data is sent to any server, API, or third party


How Analysis Works

All scam detection analysis is performed locally within your browser using JavaScript that runs as part of the extension. Page content is analyzed in real time on your device. Analysis results (threat scores and findings) are stored temporarily in browser memory for the current session only and are discarded when the tab is closed or the page is navigated away from.


Permissions

ScAIm requests the following browser permissions:

- activeTab: Required to analyze the content of the web page you are currently viewing.
- storage: Used solely to store your preference for enabling or disabling the extension. No other data is stored.


Third-Party Services

ScAIm does not use any third-party services, APIs, libraries, or external resources. The extension is entirely self-contained.


Data Sharing

Since no data is collected, no data is shared with any third party.


Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy is updated, the changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date. The core commitment — that ScAIm does not collect any user data — will not change.
